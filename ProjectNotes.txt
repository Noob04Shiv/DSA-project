The algorithm for the provided code is as follows:

1 nclude necessary libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, ctype.h.
2 Define constants: DICTIONARY_FILE as the filename of the dictionary file and MAX_WORD_LENGTH as the maximum length of a word.
3 Define functions:
    :loadDictionary: Opens the dictionary file, counts the number of words (lines) in the file, allocates memory for storing the 
    dictionary, reads words from the file, and returns the loaded dictionary.
    :isInDictionary: Checks if a given word is present in the dictionary.
    :checkSpelling: Tokenizes the input text, converts tokens to lowercase, and checks each token against the dictionary to 
    determine if it's spelled correctly.
4 In the main function:
    :Loads the dictionary using loadDictionary.
    :Prompts the user to enter text for spell checking.
    :Calls checkSpelling function to check the spelling of the entered text against the loaded dictionary.
    :Frees memory allocated for the dictionary.

Algorithm steps:

1 Open the dictionary file.
2 Count the number of words in the file to determine the dictionary size.
3 Allocate memory for the dictionary based on the number of words.
4 Read words from the file into the allocated memory for the dictionary.
5 Close the dictionary file.
5 Prompt the user to enter text for spell checking.
7 Tokenize the input text using spaces, commas, periods, and newlines as delimiters.
    For each token:
    a. Convert the token to lowercase.
    b. Check if the token is in the dictionary:
    If it's not in the dictionary, print "Misspelled word: <word>".
    If it's in the dictionary, print "correctly Spelled."
8 Free the memory allocated for each word in the dictionary and then free the memory for the dictionary itself.
9 End the program.
Note: The provided algorithm outlines the basic steps and flow of the code to load the dictionary, check spelling,
 and manage memory. The code itself reads a dictionary file, tokenizes input text, converts tokens to lowercase, 
 and checks against the loaded dictionary to determine correct spellings.
